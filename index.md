# üëã Hey, I am Ludovico üêª! 
Hey!
I am Ludovico, I am currently working as a Software engineer - Machine learning at Google Zurich. 
I am in the Account compromise protection team, detection unit. Meaning, I use ML to detect bad actors and kick them out. It's pretty cool!

In the past, before graduating with a MSc in Applied mathematics, I have interned all over Europe at: CERN, VolvoCars, Alan turing institute and ClearBox. 

I have also partecipated in the "Google summer of code" framework, where I developed a new open source library called "Surrogates.jl" for the Julia - scientific machine learning community. I am a strong believer in open source software and I plan to get back to it sooner or later. :)

This website is about learning and sharing. You will find book(s) I am currently writing and learning notes. 

I am interested broadly in ML topics, finance and all things algorithmic. I like probability a lot, which ties all my interests together quite nicely! 

# What's this website about? 
In this website, I will be writing about: 
- Coding interview resources: [passing coding interviews](./coding/codingInterviews.html)

- System desisgn resources:
    - [Grokking the system design course notes](./systems/SysDesign/SysDesign.html)
    - [Design data intensive applications notes](./systems/SysDesign/DDIA.html)
    - [Building microservices: Designing fine-grained systems notes](./systems/SysDesign/Microservices.html)

- Machine Learning notes: 
    - [Geometric deep learning](./Geometric/geo1.html)


All this resources are mainly for my own learning, but I figured It'd be good to share them in the public. In this way, I have something to keep myself in check and I can get some nice discussions going with interesting people. 

# Machine learning at scale
I started a newsletter called [Machine learning at scale](www.machinelearningatscale.com) where I discuss how Machine learning systems are used in the real world.

# Blog 
I really like writing, so I will keep a little [blog](./myblog/start_page.html) where I discuss everythig about my career, and where I will write updates about all the cool things I will be learning!

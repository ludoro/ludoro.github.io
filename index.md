# üëã Hey, I am Ludovico üêª! 
Hey!
I am Ludovico, I am currently working as a Software engineer - Machine learning at Google Zurich. I am developing ML models to defend gmail users: It's pretty cool! 
In the past, before graduating with a MSc in Applied mathematics, I have interned all over Europe at: CERN, VolvoCars, Alan turing institute and ClearBox. 

I have also partecipated in the "Google summer of code" framework, where I developed a new open source library called "Surrogates.jl" for the Julia - scientific machine learning community. I am a strong believer in open source software and I plan to get back to it sooner or later. :)

# What's this website about? 
In this website, I will be writing about: 
- My coding interview preparation: [passing coding interviews](https://hollow-wood-560.notion.site/Coding-questions-FAANG-prep-9cdf280e5f30425fa188cbbaa6d1998c)
- My (ML) System design preparation: [passing (ML) system design](./systems/SysDesign.html)
- [ML in industry](./ML_papers/ML.html), mainly describing company blog posts related to Applied ML and MLOps.
- [My learning path for ML](/ML_resources/ML.html), divided in roughly 6 macro areas: Computer vision, Reinforcement learning, Scientific machine learning, Geometric deep learning, Natural language processing and Probabilistic machine learning,
- [Probability riddles](./Prob/probability.html). Once upon a time, I was an Applied mathematician who wanted to go into quant research and probability is my favourite area of Mathematics. I still really like probability! 

All this resources are mainly for my own learning, but I figured It'd be good to share them in the public. In this way, I have something to keep myself in check and I can get some nice discussions going with interesting people. 

# Blog 
I really like writing, so I will keep a little <a href="https://ludoro.github.io/blog/">blog</a> where I discuss everythig about my career, and where I will write updates about all the cool things I will be learning!

You can expect around one email per month with a review of everything I publish here and in my blog.  


# Mentoring
I have had the luck to have really good mentors throughout my career and I know first hand the difference they made. As a way of giving back, I have also started to mentor with moderate success. If you are interested, click below:

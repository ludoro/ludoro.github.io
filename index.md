# üëã Hey, I am Ludovico üêª! 
Hey!
I am Ludovico, I am currently working as a Software engineer - Machine learning at Google Zurich. 
I am in the Account compromise protection team, detection unit. Meaning, I use ML to detect bad actors and kick them out. It's pretty cool!

In the past, before graduating with a MSc in Applied mathematics, I have interned all over Europe at: CERN, VolvoCars, Alan turing institute and ClearBox. 

I have also partecipated in the "Google summer of code" framework, where I developed a new open source library called "Surrogates.jl" for the Julia - scientific machine learning community. I am a strong believer in open source software and I plan to get back to it sooner or later. :)

This website is about learning and sharing. You will find book(s) I am currently writing and learning notes. 

I am interested broadly in ML topics, finance and all things algorithmic. I like probability a lot, which ties all my interests together quite nicely! 

# What's this website about? 
In this website, I will be writing about: 
- Coding interview resources: [passing coding interviews](./coding/codingInterviews.html)

- System desisgn resources:
    - [System design: theory and examples](./systems/SysDesign/SysDesign.html)
    - [ML system design: theory and examples](./systems/MLSysDesign/SysDesign.html)

- How companies around the world use ML to solve problems: [ML in industry](./ML_papers/ML.html)

- Learning Machine Learning: 
    - [Probabilistic machine learning](./PML/pml1.html)
    - [Geometric deep learning](./Geometric/geo1.html)
    - [Scientific machine learning](./SCIML/sciml1.html)

- Topics that I like that don't fit under a particular umbrella:
    - [Algorithms for optimization](./misc/AlgoOpt/algo1.html)
    - [Algorithms for decision making](./misc/AlgoDec/algo1.html)
    - [Uncertainty](./misc/Uncertain/uncertain1.html)
    - [Kalman filter](./misc/Kalman/kalman1.html)
    - [All things Monte-carlo](./misc/MonteCarlo/montecarlo1.html)
    - [Transformer architecture](./misc/Transformer/trans1.html)
    - [Algorithmic game theory](./misc/AlgoGMT/algoGMT.html)



All this resources are mainly for my own learning, but I figured It'd be good to share them in the public. In this way, I have something to keep myself in check and I can get some nice discussions going with interesting people. 

# Blog 
I really like writing, so I will keep a little <a href="https://ludoro.github.io/blog/">blog</a> where I discuss everythig about my career, and where I will write updates about all the cool things I will be learning!

Once upon a time, I wanted to work as a quantitative researcher in a hedge fund, so I practiced a lot of probability riddles commonly asked in those interviews. Turns out, I like riddles a lot, so it has been a fun journey.

In the end, I did not go for a quant career, but from time to time I still enjoy solving some riddles related to probability. 

I decided to write this little book containing all the questions I have solved with solutions, for two reasons:
1. I like writing math symbols
2. I see a gap in this space: many books are quite outdated and I find the solutions provided lacking.
3. I ‚ù§Ô∏è math riddles! 
If you want to see a preview of the book, you can find it [here](./books/quant.html)

# Introduction <a id="intro"></a>
I love the period between the end of the year and the start of a new year.

I don't like new year resolutions like "I will go to the gym", but I 
feel like it's a great time to reflect on what happened in the past year and what's coming up next.

So... Let's reflect! :)

# What happened in 2023? <a id="2023"></a>
**TLDR**: I am back to deep dives in my free time and writing about it!

2023 was an interesting year for me (us?).

It was a year where I had decided to focus mostly on my career progression @Google while commiting to 1 weekly post for my newsletter [Machine learning at Scale](https://www.machinelearningatscale.com/).

It has been hard!

Layoffs happended across the industry: morale was low and stress was high.

Still, there have been a few successes along the way:

- I managed to commit for ~9 months with the weekly newsletter. I have been proud of *some* articles, but mostly I felt like I **had** to write them versus enjoying the process of researching and writing about things.

- I managed to get promoted from L3 to L4 on my second try, woah!

# What's changing in 2024 for me? <a id="2024"></a>

I want to double down on what worked:

## Career

My career trajectory is exactly where I had hoped it'd be.

I want to take on more responsabilities at work as that makes me feel energized.

Not much to add here.

## Newsletter

The idea of starting a newsletter is something I don't regret.

I cherish the posts that I have written where I felt like I had learnt something new myself.

I commit to only writing posts that I *enjoy* writing.

I will not focus only on System design topics, but I will detour wherever I feel like there is something I want to talk about.

Still, I will focus on three macro areas to keep things constrained:

1. Machine learning system design: the original topics of the newsletter. I am deeply interested in the space and I feel like it's under discussed.
2. Graph neural networks: I think they are cool. Enough said!
3. All things LLM related: I am not one for jumping on hype-trains, but... there is just so much cool innovation going on in the space I can't resist diving into it.

## Software products

I want to exercise more my product side of brain.

Just building something small and tiny that solves a specific issue.

I know that this goal feels underdefined, but I am already working on some small things on the side.

It's enjoyable to use some outside-world tools and create something you own end to end.

And now, I can't wait to check in late 2024 to see what I accomplished this year :D

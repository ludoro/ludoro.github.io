# ML resources
I have decided to focus on 5 different macroareas: Computer vision, Reinforcement learning, Scientific machine learning, Geometric deep learning, Natural language processing.
I will list learning resources / code snippets as I am studying them myself. Some topics that I will study are shared between sections (e.g. Transformers).

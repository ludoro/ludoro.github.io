# Geometric deep learning 

## The following sections are my notes from the book "Graph representation learning" by William Hamilton: 
- [Introduction - Machine learning on graphs]()
- [Traditional approaches - Kernel methods, Neighborhood overlap detection, Spectral methods]()
- [Neighborhood reconstruction methods - Encoder-Decoder, Factorization approach, Random walk embeddings]()
- [Multi-relational Data and Knowledge graphs]()
- [Graph neural networks: Message passing, Generalized Neighborhood aggregation, Generalized update methods, Edge features and Multi-relational GNNs]()
- [GNN in practice: Applications and Loss functions, Node sampling, Parameter sharing and Regularization]()
- [Theoretical Motivations: GNNs vs Convolutions, GNNs and Probabilistic models, GNNs and graph isomorphism]()
- [Traditional graph generation approaches]()
- [Deep generative models - Variational Autoencoder approaches, Adversarial approaches, Autoreggressive Methods, Evaluating graph generation]()

## Applying GNNs to huge graphs:
- [GraphSAGE]()
- [PinSage]()

## Doing anomaly detection on (with) graphs:
- [PyGOD]()

## Dealing with continuous-time step dynamic graphs:
- [Temporal graph networks for Deep learning on Dynamic graphs]()
- [Inductive Representation learning on Temporal graphs]()

      <h1 id="introduction---my-open-source-path-">Introduction - my open source path <a id="intro"></a></h1>

<p>Today I want to write about my open source contributions and why 
I think it was the turning point in my software career.</p>

<p>It was December 2017, I was in my second year of my undergraduate degree in Applied mathematics taking a C++ course. The final evaluation consisted in a <a href="https://github.com/ludoro/Matlab_project">huge team project</a> related to 3D geometry and intersecating objects.</p>

<p>While working on it, I started to realize how much I liked writing software, as opposed to studying theoretical math. At that time, I was day dreaming about doing Applied math research. Then, I told myself I could combing my math skills with my newly found coding hobby.</p>

<p>Still, I was painfully aware that the academia career is a really hard one that does not pay off most of the times, so I started working towards an alternative plan: why not use math and software in industry? I realized that I neede to showcase my coding abilities if I wanted to do that, and a silly undocumented 3D geometry project might not be enough.</p>

<p>I was too scared (read: underprepared) to apply to big tech internships, so I had to find something else that could still be combined with my studies. 
On reddit, I read about the ‚ÄúGoogle summer of code‚Äù (GSOC) program. It seemed the perfect fit!</p>

<p>I also found a really interesting project related to speeding up matrix computations using C++. Withouth knowing any better, I started writing my proposal and I submitted it.
Unfortunately, I was rejected üíî! 
In hindsight, this is really not surprising:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I did not interact with the open source community to check what I should be focusing on ‚ùå</li>
  <li>I did not write a single Pull request (PR) for the project ‚ùå</li>
</ul>

<p>Who in their right mind would have taken me on?</p>

<p>I started investigating the hidden tips and tricks needed to increase my chances next year.</p>

<p>December 2018 comes around, this time I knew how to play the game a little better. I chose ‚ÄúJulia programming language‚Äù as a project (v0.7, how time flies). It seemed a really promising language, suited for a wannabe Applied mathemtician. I knew this was it!</p>

<p>I was interested in a project concerned surrogate models to approximate expensive solutions of differential equations. They required math, optimization techniques and numerical computing knowledge. It was the perfect fit for me!</p>

<ul>
  <li>I started chatting with Chris Rackauckas, the mentor for the project to ask for directions and tips. ‚úÖ</li>
  <li>I started writing code showcasing early features of the future library ‚úÖ</li>
</ul>

<p>I applied again. This time, I felt more confident about my chances!
Again, I was rejected! üíîüíî</p>

<p>This time, I was really down.</p>

<p>I was on the phone with my girlfriend venting about this, when I got an email from the Julia organization:</p>

<p><img src="/images/avikEmail.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I will always remember that evening! Julia was willing to sponsor me with their own funds because they did not get the number of slots they hoped for in the GSOC. I still feel grateful to this day.</p>

<p>I have worked on <a href="https://github.com/SciML/Surrogates.jl">Surrogates.jl</a> that summer and in the next summer under the ‚ÄúGoogle summer of code‚Äù and in my own free time as well. Thanks to this experiences, I got my internship at the Alan turing institute, still using Julia.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-open-source-experience-so-valuable-for-students-">Why is open source experience so valuable for students? <a id="back"></a></h1>

<p>The common advice for students that want to bulk up their CV for applications is to do <em>projects</em>. This is fine advice, but most of the time the project is not that impressive or, worse, a slight variation of some tutorial. In such cases, It becomes hard to differentiate yourself from other applicants. Moreover, these projects do not usually have any users, It‚Äôs just a github repository with some README.md description.</p>

<p>Having an open source project is a totally different story.</p>

<p>You have users: documenting software is as important as writing it. ‚úÖ</p>

<p>You must write tests to avoid nasty bugs. ‚úÖ</p>

<p>You are collaborating with other developers working alongside you on the library. ‚úÖ</p>

<p>This is as close as it gest to a real SWE job! If you like working on open source projects with other people, there is a good chance you are going to like your career as a SWE. This was especially important to me coming from an Applied Mathematics background: I needed to make sure this is something I enjoy doing!</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts<a id="final"></a></h1>

<p>It is my hope that this post convinced eager students craving real work experience to start working on open source software. There are many opportunities in the space, namely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Google summer of code</li>
  <li>Google Season of Docs</li>
  <li>MHL Fellowship</li>
  <li>NumFocus grants</li>
  <li>Linux Kernel Mentorship Program</li>
  <li>GirlScript Summer of Code</li>
  <li>RailsGirls summer of code</li>
  <li>Outreachy</li>
  <li>Open Summer of Code</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is to pick an organization within this frameworks that aligns closely with your interests, so you can produce your best work!</p>

<p>Feel free to message me if you need some sort of guidance to make the process less intimidating!</p>

<p>Ludo</p>
